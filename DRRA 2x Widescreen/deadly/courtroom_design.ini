; The chatbox image used for smallest possible size is "chat". "chatblank" is used if the showname is whitespace-only.
; "chatmed" will be used if the showname size exceeds the width, at which point the showname will receive showname_extra_width.
; "chatbig" will be used if the showname size exceeds the "chatmed" width, at which point the showname will receive showname_extra_width again.
; Text any bigger than that will be cut off. If "chatmed" or "chatbig" are missing, showname will not be resized.

; Where the text will be aligned in the showname box.
; Possible options include:
; left
; center

; justify (like in newspapers)

; IC message, positioned within the chatbox. Changing 250 affects how
; long text goes on before going onto the next line. Changing 89 affects
; how many lines you can see before the message starts scrolling, based on
; Every line height is 25 if the font size is 10 and the Sans font is used.
; There's 4 pixels from X position until the symbol is displayed.
; the formula of n =25+(n-1)*16, where n is the number of lines to be
; displayed. (ie, set it to 25 for 1 line, 41 for 2, 57 for 3, 73 for 4,
; 89 for 5, 105 for 6... Less than 25 displays nothing)
message = 109, 57, 507, 80

; A chat indicator alerting us the chat ticker isn't active (text is no longer being processed).
